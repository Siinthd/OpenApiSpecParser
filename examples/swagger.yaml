    Official OpenAPI Specification for IPinfo's comprehensive IP intelligence API. This specification defines all endpoints for IP geolocation, ASN data, company information, privacy detection, and specialized data services.

    ## Authentication

    All endpoints support three authentication methods:
    - **HTTP Basic Auth**: Use your token as the username with empty password
    - **Bearer Token**: Include token in Authorization header
    - **Query Parameter**: Pass token as `?token=YOUR_TOKEN`
